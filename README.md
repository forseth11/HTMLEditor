A java class I made for an application I am making which makes it easier to use the JTextPane.  This makes it easy to use undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, bold, underline, italic, colors, fonts, font size, alignment, tables, and find. None of the actual components are made except for JTextPane.  It is up to you where you want to put buttons for formatting the text.
